  <h3>What Happened</h3>
  <p>
    This is an automated notification to inform you that the upcoming milestones
    for your ChromeStatus feature have been reset.

  <h3>Reason for this Change</h3>
  <p>
    This action was taken because the accuracy of your feature's data was not
    verified in response to our recent notifications.

    verification notifications sent by ChromeStatus. This ensures your
    milestones remain active and your feature's data remains accurate.

Hello! This is your friendly neighborhood <strong>automated reminder script</strong> here. I just ran on  and
identified the following facts:
<ul>
  <li>
    The next release to branch is <strong>M200</strong>
    on January 31 2030.
  </li>
  <li>
    The current stable release is <strong>M201</strong>
    as of February 1 2030
  </li>
  <li>There are <strong>100</strong> emails to be sent.</li>
</ul>
Could you please double check my work and make sure I sent the right emails?
I'm looking forward to slowly replacing you through the
<strong>inexorable tide</strong> of automation!<br /><br />

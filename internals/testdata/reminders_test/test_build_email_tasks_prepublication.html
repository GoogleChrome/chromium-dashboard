<p>Your feature is slated to ship in M100 which will reach the
beta channel on 2022-09-21.</p>

<p>About one week before that date, the summary field of your feature
entry will be used verbatim (in blog posts and enterprise release
notes) to announce this new milestone.  These posts are widely read by
web developers and IT admins, and they are sometimes used as the basis
for popular press articles.</p>

<h2>1. Locate your releases on the roadmap.</h2>
<p>Please check where your feature appears on the
<a href="http://127.0.0.1:8888/roadmap">roadmap page</a>.
If your feature does not appear, you may need to fill in
milestone values or update the feature's implementation status.
Be sure that you have gotten all needed approvals.</p>

<p>Features can appear multiple times in different milestones or
different sections depending on how they are released.  Check that
the sequence of releases for your feature makes sense from the
perspective of a web developer.  For example, dev trials should come
before the feature is enabled by default.</p>

<h2>2. Refine your feature summary.</h2>
<p>Please take a look at
  <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/tags/beta/"
     >past blog posts</a> and
  <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/7679408"
     >enterprise release notes</a>,
and then revise your feature summary to prepare it for
publication.</p>

<p>Here's what we have now for publication:</p>
<h3>feature one</h3>
<p>sum</p>

<p><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8888/guide/edit/123">Edit your feature</a></p>



<p>Guidelines for writing the summary:</p>
<ul>

  <li>Provide a one sentence description followed by one or two lines
  explaining how this feature works and how it helps web
  developers.</li>

  <li>Write from a web developer's point of view, not a browser developer's.</li>

  <li>Do not use markup or markdown because they will not be rendered.</li>

  <li>Do not use hard or soft returns because they will not be rendered.</li>

  <li>Avoid phrases such as "a new feature". Every feature on the site
  was new when it was created. You don't need to repeat that
  information.</li>

  <li>The first line should be a sentence fragment beginning with a
  verb. (See below.) This is the rare exception to the requirement to
  always use complete sentences.</li>

  <li>"Conformance with spec" is not adequate. Most if not all
  features are in conformance to spec.</li>
</ul>

<p>Example:</p>

<p style="border: 1px solid #444; padding: 1em; margin: 1em">
  Splits the HTTP cache using the top frame origin (and possibly
  subframe origin) to prevent documents from one origin from knowing
  whether a resource from another origin was cached. The HTTP cache is
  currently one per profile, with a single namespace for all resources
  and subresources regardless of origin or renderer process. Splitting
  the cache on top frame origins helps the browser deflect
  side-channel attacks where one site can detect resources in another
  site's cache.

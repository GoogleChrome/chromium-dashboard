    <blockquote>
    Splits the HTTP cache using the top frame origin (and possibly subframe origin) to prevent documents from one origin from knowing whether a resource from another origin was cached. The HTTP cache is currently one per profile, with a single namespace for all resources and subresources regardless of origin or renderer process. Splitting the cache on top frame origins helps the browser deflect side-channel attacks where one site can detect resources in another site's cache.

      The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/">W3C Technical Architecture Group</a> (TAG)
      is a special working group of the W3C that consists of a few appointed and elected members,
      all of whom are experienced members of the web standards community.
      The Blink launch process has a formal requirement for requesting a
      <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/w3ctag/design-reviews">TAG specification review</a>
      for all features. The review happens publicly on a GitHub issue.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will likely have asked for an "<a target="_blank" href=
        "https://github.com/w3ctag/design-reviews/issues/new?template=005-early-design-review.md"
      >Early Design Review</a>" earlier in the process to get the TAG familiar with your feature.
      This isn't that.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's recommended that you file a TAG <a target="_blank" href=
        "https://github.com/w3ctag/design-reviews/issues/new?template=010-specification-review.md"
      >Specification Review</a> as soon as your specification is written, and at least a month ahead of sending an Intent to Ship.
      There may be some work involved in preparing your feature for review (see the
      <a target="_blank" href=
        "https://github.com/w3ctag/design-reviews/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/010-specification-review.md"
      >submission template fields</a>).
    </p>
    <p>
      A large number of Intents to Ship are delayed because a TAG specification review was only
      recently filed and engagement from the TAG can take multiple weeks to multiple months.

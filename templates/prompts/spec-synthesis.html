Role: You are an expert technical writer and web platform architect. You excel at deconstructing large, dense specification documents and synthesizing new, focused documentation for a specific feature.

Core Directive: I will provide you with input data in XML format containing a `<spec_document>`, {% if explainer_content %}`<explainer_documents>`, {% endif %}and a `<feature_definition>`. Your task is to:

1.  Use the `<feature_definition>` to identify the precise *scope* of the feature.
2.  **Action:** Read and analyze the text provided within the `<spec_document>` {% if explainer_content %}and `<explainer_documents>` {% endif %}tags.
3.  Ingest the full technical context of this provided document to find all details that fall within the defined scope.
4.  **Synthesize** all of this information into a *new, single, **comprehensive technical reference*** that describes *only* the feature, organized by the structure below.

---

**Output Requirements:**

* **Depth of Detail:** **Prioritize completeness over brevity.** The output must be as descriptive and detailed as is necessary to cover all required information found in the spec. Do not summarize away technical nuances or omit edge cases.
* Your response must be a high-quality, standalone description of the feature, written as if it were its own technical documentation.
* The *only* source for your content must be the technical facts provided in the `<spec_document>`{% if explainer_content %} and `<explainer_documents>`{% endif %}.
* The *only* scope for your content is defined by the `<feature_definition>`.
* **You must organize the content using the following logical structure:**
    1.  **Overview:** A high-level summary of the feature's purpose.
    2.  **Existence:** Define the feature's *surface area* (all relevant interfaces, methods, properties, CSS definitions, etc.).
    3.  **Common Use Cases (Core Functionality):** Describe the specified *successful* behaviors, processing models, and realistic "happy paths."
    4.  **Likely Error Scenarios:** Describe all specified error conditions, thrown exceptions, invalid states, and constraints.
    5.  **Invalidation:** Describe all specified behaviors related to caching, state changes, and dynamic updates. (If not specified, state "No specific invalidation or dynamic behaviors are defined.")
    6.  **Integration with Other Features:** Describe all specified behaviors that define how this feature *must* interact with other platform features. (If not specified, state "No specific integrations are defined.")

**Crucial Constraints:**

* **DO NOT** talk *about* the spec (e.g., "The spec says in section 4...").
* **DO NOT** just copy and paste large, raw sections without synthesizing them.
* **DO NOT** include any information from the spec that is *outside* the scope of the feature.
* Only use the feature name, description, and the provided spec content as the source of truth for understanding the feature.

Here are the inputs:

<spec_document url="{{ spec_url }}">
  {{ spec_content }}
</spec_document>
{% if explainer_content %}
<explainer_documents>
  {{ explainer_content }}
</explainer_documents>
{% endif %}
<feature_definition>
  {{ feature_definition }}
</feature_definition>

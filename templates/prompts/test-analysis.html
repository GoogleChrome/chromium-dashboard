**Role:** You are an expert-level test engineer and browser developer with master-level knowledge of web specifications (W3C, WHATWG) and browser internals. Your primary skill is deconstructing web-platform-tests to understand their precise intent and coverage.

**Task:** I will provide you with the complete contents of a single web-platform-test (WPT) file, `<test_file>`, as well as all of its dependency files, 0 or more `<dependency_file>`. Your task is to analyze this `<test_file>` and all `<dependency_file>` contents to provide a detailed, factual breakdown of exactly what is being tested, organized by the categories below.

---

**Output Requirements:**

1.  **Summary:** Begin with a concise, one-sentence summary of the test file's primary goal.
2.  **Detailed Breakdown:** Structure your analysis using the following categories. Be specific and reference exact methods, properties, or behaviors found in the main file or its dependencies.
    * **Key Functionality:** What high-level web platform feature or capability is the main target of this test?
    * **Existence Checks:** Enumerate the exact APIs, methods, properties, and constructors being invoked. Note any tests that *only* check for the existence or parsability of a feature (e.g., `idlharness.js`, CSS parsing).
    * **Common Use Case Tests:** Describe the specific *successful*, end-to-end behaviors and realistic scenarios being asserted.
    * **Error Scenario Tests:** Describe the specific *failure* conditions, invalid inputs, out-of-bounds values, or promise rejections being asserted.
    * **Invalidation Tests:** Describe any tests that change an initial state (e.g., via script) and assert that the feature's results are correctly updated or invalidated.
    * **Integration Tests:** Describe any tests that assert behavior involving a *combination* of this feature and another distinct web platform feature.

**Constraints:**

* **Be Factual:** Base your analysis *only* on the code present in the provided `<test_file>` content **and** the `<dependency_file>` contents.
* **No Speculation:** Do not infer what *might* be missing or what *should* be tested. Stick strictly to what *is* being tested.
* **Be Specific:** Avoid vague descriptions.

**Documents for Analysis:**

{{ testfile_contents }}

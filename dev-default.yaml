# This GAE service is just an empty placeholder because we need a default
# service in py3 when doing development on workstations.  On GAE, the
# py2 service defined in py/app-py2.yaml is used.

# As of 2022-02-14 this file is not actually used because start_server.sh
# runs gunicorn directly instead of using dev_appserver.   If dev_appserver
# is updated to work under py3, then we could start using it again and we
# would use this file.

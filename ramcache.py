This module manages a distributed RAM cache as a global python dictionary in
each AppEngine instance.  AppEngine can spin up new instances or kill old ones
at any time.  Each instance's RAM cache is independent and might not have the
same entries as found in the RAM caches of other instances.

Each instance will do the work needed to compute a given RAM cache entry
itself.  The values computed in a given instance will speed up future requests
made to that instance only.

When the user edits something in the app, the updated entity is stored in
datastore.  Also, the singleton SharedInvalidate entity is updated with the
timestamp of the change.  Every request handler must start processing a request
by first calling SharedInvalidate.check_for_distributed_invalidation() which
checks for any needed invalidations and clears RAM cache entries in
that instance if needed.

For now, there is only a single RAM cache per instance and when anything is
invalidated, that entire RAM cache is completely cleared.  In the future,
invalidations could be compartmentalized by RAM cache type, or even specific
entity IDs.  Monorail uses that approach, but existing ChromeStatus code does
not need it.

Calling code must not mutate any value that is passed into set() or returned
from get().  If calling code needs to mutate such objects, it should call
copy.copy() or copy.deepcopy() to avoid unintentional cumulative mutations.

Unlike memcache, this RAM cache has no concept of expiration time.  So,
whenever a cached value would become invalid, it must be invalidated.
